# stock-analysis
## Purpose
#### The purpose of this project was to help Steve to analyse the stock data for different stocks to find their return rate over the whole year. We compared different stocks data to analyse their performance throughout the year using VBA macros.
## Results
#### Following observations were taken from year [2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e6pEMGqpVAEgI2BwS3gBmJRzfnC6GtaG/view?usp=sharing) and [2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FLy4nS9aPITxghc4JQELa_AgyxMiU9o0/view?usp=sharing) where it is clear that 2017 had a high return rate as compared to 2018.Only TERP went down in 2017 while in 2018 only ENPH and RUN made profit.
## Summary
### Advantages:
#### Because of automated script, it is easy to analyse the data. It saves time when we use the macros created during this task.
#### Because of VBA script, analysis can be done on multiple years which will save time in future.
### Disadvantages:
#### During refactoring, coding was a bit complex, chances of making mistakes were pretty high for a first-time user.It consumed a good time in order to write a VBA script for refactoring.
